# What we are building and why  Team Andromedus  Alexis Hoshino, Eric Tian, HQ Pham-Nguyen, Kathleen Enverga  ## What we are building  We are building a web application that will mine Facebook and other aspects of an individual’s digital life and allow users to create something in remembrance of the deceased. As a 3rd party application, Epilogue will not operate under Facebook. The application will transfer Facebook data of the deceased and memorial owners will be able to organize the data into a presentable manner. Users will interact with the software by creating and editing memorials and stories as a way to remember their loved one(s). Memorials can be finalized so they do not have to be constantly maintained.
 ## Why we are building it
Facebook lacks sensitive management of a deceased person’s account. If a non-Facebook friend tries to access the deceased person’s Facebook account, it will redirect them to a link saying that the page is no longer available, accompanied by a broken thumb. Epilogue is a service project in which users will be able to memorialize their deceased loved one’s digital life in Facebook. We want to introduce a new way to take ownership of a deceased person’s account. It presents a new way of grieving and remembrance that incorporates data from social media.

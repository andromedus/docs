## What we are building  

We are building a standalone web application that will gather information from a person’s digital life (Facebook, initially, then other social media/digital presences) and allow users to create a memorial in remembrance of the deceased. The application will process and present the information collected about the deceased in the form of a private online pages. Users will be able to edit the memorial and add their own stories as a way to remember their loved one, as well as have the option to finalize it into a more permanent state.

## Why we are building it

We want to introduce a new tool for the family and friends of the deceased to gather information from their passed loved one’s digital life. Based on research from our sponsor, Jed Brubaker, a large issue surrounding a person’s digital life after they have passed is the accessibility and stewardship over their information on social media. Currently, social media websites like Facebook lack sensitive management of a deceased user’s account. Epilogue seeks to be an application that users can use to help memorialize their deceased loved one’s digital information that otherwise may be lost or inaccessible.

 ## File management  We will use Git and GitHub for code management.

We will use Google Docs for document drafting and management.

We will use Asana for project management.  Specifically, we will keep files in GitHub repositories owned by our sponsor, "Epilogue."  We will keep documentation in the "docs" repository.  ## Miscellaneous
If a team member is unable to attend a meeting or co-working hour, he or she must notify the team as soon as possible. No penalties will be applied if team has been informed beforehand.

If a team member does not show up to a meeting or co-working hour without prior notice, he or she must bring any type of food for the team in the next meeting.

Text messages should be checked on a daily basis (preferably once every three hours).

GroupMe, Google Hangouts, and e-mail will be used for all communication purposes.  We agree to help each other to the best of our abilities.

We agree to respect and understand each other’s opinions, concerns and responsibilities.

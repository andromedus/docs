## Assessment
 #### What did you deliver to your sponsor at the end of spring quarter? 
-We delivered a functioning website. We had worked on several features such as grabbing photos, videos, and statuses from Facebook, creating stories, and uploading photos and videos. We also worked on the front-end portion of the website. We created several mock-ups, primarily focusing on the memorial view. Some functional requirements we met were to finish the CRUDding for each feature (photos, statuses, videos, and stories). 

#### What feedback did your sponsor give you?
-Functionality is good, it’s all there for a base product, we have implemented all of the main features of the application including collaborators, stories, videos, and photos, as well as gained a lot of understanding of the code base we inherited.  Some things need to be cleaned up and organized across the webapp and made more consistent, however overall our sponsor gave us very positive feedback about our work this quarter.

#### What functional and nonfunctional requirements remain to be met for the final product?
- UI Implementation across the entire site
- Consistency fixes across the website
- Clearing out bugs in our issue tracker
- Create a business/release strategy plan

#### What other work do you need to do to deliver the final product?
- Create a business/release strategy plan

#### Are there some requirements for the final product that are not yet clear? If so, how can you get clear about them?
- How exactly we are deploying the product, receiving user feedback. However this is something that our sponsor hinted at us making the decisions around this when we create our release strategy plan over the summer.

 ####What is the most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product?
-Our final product should have a polished, consistent UI across all of the web pages. Our product should also behave as we expect: no links or actions  should lead to error pages, and the backend and frontend should be smoothly integrated.
 ####What skills are needed to do this work?
-HTML/CSS skills are needed for the front-end as well as knowing PHP and some Laravel syntax to put the correct Facebook call results into the modules on the front-end.
-PHP, database, Laravel skills are needed for the back-end. 
 ####Who in the team has these skills? Who does not?
+Alexis: Needs to improve all front-end skills: reading and writing CSS, Laravel Forms, using page partials, and basic aesthetic sense such as trending layout design elements.
+ Eric: Need to learn how Facebook call works and need to learn a lot about the Facebook PHP API that we are using. Able to do basic PHP/Laravel/HTML/CSS coding and get things done, but would like to learn these more in depth and become more comfortable especially with tackling errors/bugs.
+ HQ: Is comfortable on the front-end and would need to learn more about the Facebook API and implementing Facebook calls; want to learn HTML/CSS more in depth as well; still need to learn Laravel more thoroughly.
+ Kathleen: Needs improvement on reading and writing code, especially those relevant to project.
 ####How can team members without these skills get them?
+ By dedicating time towards learning the skills. From team learning sessions to independent study, team members can achieve the better understanding of the project’s technologies.




## Timeline
The timeline should include all tasks that need to be done to deliver the final product. 
You should create the timeline with the goal of delivering the final product at the end of fall quarter. 
The timeline should include learning tasks, communication tasks (between team members and between the team and the sponsor), implementation tasks, testing tasks, deployment tasks, and any other tasks you can think of. 
On the timeline, tasks should be assigned to specific people on the team (or to the sponsor; e.g., “get web server credentials from old webmaster”).


#####Learning Tasks
+ Alexis: Learn how to create and  manage communication via a “Contact Us” feature on the site, 
+ Eric: Finish reading the “Codebright” Laravel book. Learn about bootstrap by tinkering with it and read over and understand the current codebase in full context.
+ HQ: Learn more HTML/CSS by creating things with it. Still want to finish reading the “Code Bright” book Eric shared with everyone at the beginning of the quarter. 
+ Kathleen: Read upon different project technologies, focusing on HTML/CSS/PHP. Also, learn more about the laravel framework and bootstrap. Find the right source for learning the material.

#####Communication Tasks
+ Alexis: Update team and sponsor every Monday or after every significant issue’s discovery or resolution.
+ Eric: Update sponsor and teammates throughout summer as to what I’m up to every ~2weeks.
+ HQ: Communicate with the team over summer; participate in the google mailing list Six set up for the class. 
+ Kathleen: Update the team and sponsor once every week to two weeks about tasks completed.

+ Eric: Initial walkthrough of the system tests and find a few volunteers for user testing on the webapp
+ HQ: Conduct user tests on the system.
+ Kathleen: Challenge myself by creating my own mini-projects and involving myself in small coding sessions, either individually or in groups.

#####Deployment Tasks
+ Alexis: Help create a deployment plan/strategy.
+ Eric: Help create a deployment plan/strategy.
+ HQ: Help create a deployment plan/strategy.
+ Kathleen: Deploy an enriched mindset about the project’s technologies.

## Time and place

LUCI Lab, Donald Bren Hall, Irvine, CA, Mon Apr. 10, 11 AM 

## Communication schedule

We will meet with Jed and PKG in person every Monday at the LUCI Lab from 11AM - 2PM.

During the meeting, we will discuss things that we have achieved and had trouble with. We will share meetings notes and other files necessary in order to keep everyone informed. The files will be shared in a Google Docs within PKGâ€™s folder at the end of each meeting.

## Project goals

Our project goal is to deploy Epilogue to the public by the end of Spring Quarter and have users test it out. We also plan on adding new features to the website, which will be discussed in the weeks to come. Our subgoal is to correctly convert the old version into a framework environment, giving it an enterprise feel.

## Other notes

During week 2, we plan to set up our environments and tools such as Laravel and Vagrant.

We plan to finish up our class deliverables in the same week in order to structure our plan for the next few weeks.
